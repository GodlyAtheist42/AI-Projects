# AI-Projects

The two projects that I've worked on are:

1. A program to solve the 11-puzzle using the A* algorithm with graph search. The heuristic
used is the sum of Manhattan distances of the tiles from their positions in the goal state.

2. A program to solve the hyper sudoku puzzle using the backtracking algorithm.
The heuristics used are the Minimum Remaining Value and degree heuristics.
